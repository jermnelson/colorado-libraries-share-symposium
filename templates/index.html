            <p class="question">What was your goal for this project?</p>
                        <p>The goal of this project is to create a cost-effective and flexible 
            <a href="https://dp.la">DP.LA</a> service hub for 
          Colorado and Wyoming. The Digital Public Library of America is non-profit that 
            provides a central web site for discovering 
          and accessing freely available material and resources contained in libraries, archives, and museums in North America.
          DP.LA service hub aggregates metadata and links from libraries and museums in a geographical region to be included in DP.LA 
          primary search portal.</p>

         <p>Under the sponsorship of the Colorado State Library, the proof-of-concept includes 
            participation of the Denver
            Public Library, Colorado College, and History Colorado digital collections.
          <p class="question">&hellip; and why do you feel that the solution you chose was the best way to reach that goal?</p> 
          <p>
            Building upon research and development of a BIBFRAME Linked-Data pilot (initially funded 
            through a contract
            with the Library of Congress and available at <a href="http://bibcat.org/">bibcat.org</a>) a 
            linked-data based proof-of-concept of a Colorado-Wyoming DPLA Service Hub is available
            under an open-source license at 
            <a href="https://github.com/KnowledgeLinks/dpla-service-hub">https://github.com/KnowledgeLinks/dpla-service-hub</a>.

            <p class="question">What surprised you about the process of developing your technology solution?</p>
            <p>The realization of the promise of open-source Linked-Data bibliographic systems. 
            I believe the easy of modern web, cloud, and NoSQL datastore technologies offers libraries 
            new avenues and opportunities for our applying our new skills, talents, and experience to 
            existing challenges of bibliographic management of our traditional physicals collections of 
            books, periodicals, to new services and collaborations among memory institutions in our
            communities. </p> 
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="question">What's next for your project?</p>
            <p>Next week, we are meeting Emily Gore of DP.LA for consulting and preparing for a full
            pilot by expanding the proof-of-concept to include all of our partner institutions. 
            If you are interested in participating in the Colorado/Wyoming DPLA service hub, please e-mail me 
            at <a href="mailto:jeremy.nelson@coloradocollege.edu">jeremy.nelson@coloradocollege.edu</a>
            or Leigh Jeremias (ljeremias at coloradovirtuallibrary.org) of the Colorado Virtual Library.

            <p class="question">What advice can you give other libraries who are considering 
            taking part in a collaborative technology project?</p>
            <p>
                The costs of technologies are decreasing such that libraries can afford to 
                experiment more to improve our own workflows and services. By adopting 
                established open-source technologies and project management techniques like
                libraries expand the resources and opportunities of our communities.
            </p>
